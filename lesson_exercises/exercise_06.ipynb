        "**A maximum likelihood estimation is a constrained optimization problem if we have explicit consideration of the constraints on our equation in the problem often shown with s.t. for such. It is important to include which variables the s.t. is for in the expression. For handling constraints when using BFGS, one should go and take the log of the likelihood of the function to try and get rid of parameter restrictions present. In Powell's method, the way to deal with the constraints is setting all disallowed parameters to negative âˆž. Doing this should give a proper numerical MLE estimate in this method.**\n",
